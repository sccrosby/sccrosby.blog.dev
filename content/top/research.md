## Waves in Estuaries
Oneâ€™s first though when considering ocean waves might be those that roll gently up our beaches, providing endless entertainment of surfers, body boarders, and beach goers alike. However, waves drive many processes along our coastlines including, beach erosion, coastal flooding, and alongshore transport of sediment, larvae and pollutants. Additionally, large wave energy provide a significant hazard to coastal infrastructure, beach goers and commercial and recreational boating.  Therefore accurate, unbiased, high-resolution nearshore wave predictions are needed by both local communities and researchers. 

Estuaries and bays are protected from a majority of remotely generated wave energy, however, storms events, characterized by low pressure systems and strong pressure gradients, produce near hurricane wind force that drive significant local wave generation. For example, on Dec 20th 2018 winds approached 60-mph generating strong waves throughout the Salish Sea. Wave run-up reached the grass at Marine Park in Bellingham (image at left), moved rocks and wood debri onto the Lummi Shore road, destroyed the ocean-side lane of Birch Bay drive, and caused [serious damage](https://komonews.com/news/local/birch-bay-restaurant-destroyed-by-wild-waves-fueled-by-fierce-winds) to the Bay Breeze restaurant in Birch Bay.

## Offshore waves
Along open coastlines incident most wave energy is generated by distant storms. On partially sheltered shorelines, wave predictions are sensitive to the directions (e.g. animation on left) of onshore propagating waves, and nearshore model prediction error is often dominated by directional uncertainty offshore. I developed methods to estimate very-high resolution offshore directional wave spectra assimilating global wave model predictions [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/) and in-situ buoy observations. 

The methods developed will aid in rational buoy network design. Initial method development focused in southern California where the [California Data Information Program](https://cdip.ucsd.edu/) maintains a dense buoy network. These observations act as a large incoherent array, provides strong directional constraints on the offshore wave spectra. 
These methods are applicable all along the western US coastline, and are currently under development for the Washington coastline. Wave transformation is rapidly modeled by linear transformation using backwards ray tracing. Ray-tracing provides improved results over typical wave models (e.g. [Crosby et al, 2019](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JTECH-D-18-0123.1)) and methods are becoming available in a public repository ([Ray Tracer](https://github.com/sccrosby/RayTracer)).
