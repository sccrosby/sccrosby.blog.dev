I was inspired to explore this topic after reading a great introduction to random forests by [Will Koehrsen](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-in-python-24d0893d51c0). Here, Will uses a year of temperatures measured in Seattle create a model that predicts tomorrow's maximum temperature using the two days prior and some other pieces of information.  Following along I did the same an
